# netty-channel-fsm-osgi
This repository contains the MANIFEST.MF file of **the Eclipse plug-in project** for building OSGi bundle from the netty-channel-fsm 0.3 of [netty-channel-fsm
](https://github.com/digitalpetri/netty-channel-fsm) and the built bundle file. You need Java 8 or higher.

I use this with the following bundles.
- [Netty 4.1.38](https://netty.io/index.html) netty-handler-4.1.38.Final.jar, netty-transport-4.1.38.Final.jar

- [SLF4J 1.7.26](https://www.slf4j.org/)

- [Strict Machine 0.1](https://github.com/digitalpetri/strict-machine/tree/v0.1)  
I use the pre-built [strict-machine-osgi_0.1.0.jar](https://github.com/s5uishida/strict-machine-osgi).

I would like to thank the authors of this very useful netty-channel-fsm code, and all the contributors.
